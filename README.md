# TicTacToeJS_9.8
Final Project for the Intro to JS high shcool class I teach
This is a javascript game. 

The issue is the togglePlayer function is not changeing between the X and O. I fixed the issue I originally had with an extra function inside the toggelPlayer function, but now the displayWinner function no longer works. I don't understand what's wrong with the code and need help. I teach a high school class and this course did not come with any teacher resources so I have to solve this so I can assist my students and grade their work, which includes feedback on why their code is not working as expected. I can't do this for this assignment because I am stuck also. 

If you can answer my question please email me at srachal674@gmail.com
Your help is appreciated!
